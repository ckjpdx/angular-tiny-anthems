### My Main Flaw: Patience

The thing I need to work on most is problem solving things that are not readily available from documentation or tutorials. I started an Angular project that I wanted to incorporate user account creation and login, but quickly found that I'd have to read between the lines in order to get it to work. Updates to Firebase technology meant that Angular 2 tutorials were not entirely accurate anymore. After an hour of trying to force it to work, I discovered something called a "migration guide", something I had not heard of before. This was apparently a way to tie loose ends together in the documentation, but it requires reading and careful consideration to exact the solution amidst the chaos. 

### My Mission: Dig Deeper

Angular Firebase modules have been split up, and there's no easy copy and paste implementation for user account creation.

How to solve it



## Angular 2 Info

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
